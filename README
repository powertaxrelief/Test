//This is the readme file in the Test directory
//This file will contain the instructions for pulling and pushing code to Github
  //In this case, how to pull/push README file.  Will work for any others as well.

From the command line (Push):
  Go to directory you'd like to pull/push with Github
  Type:
    git init
    git add README
    git commit -m 'first commit'
      //-m message flag
      //'first commit' not necessary, but will help identify file versions down the road
    git remote add origin https://github.com/powertaxrelief/'RepositoryNameOnGitHub'.git
    git push origin master
